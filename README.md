# Introduction
This is the first project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

This project will also showcase;
- Knowing all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.

- Being comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.

- Knowing how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a usable format.

- Experience in communicating the results of my analysis.

- Being able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code.

- Familiarity with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently

- Knowing how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings.

## Datasets
One of the datasets used for this project come from the [FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics). The NICS is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives.
The data has been supplemented with state level data from [census.gov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.census.gov/&sa=D&ust=1532469042127000). Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase.
